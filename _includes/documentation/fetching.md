	<h4>Important change with Graph API 2.4</h4>
	<div>Facebook made a breaking change with Graph API 2.4 and you now have to provide the <code>fields</code> parameter to get the fields you need. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/07/08/graph-api-v2.4/" target="_blank">According to Facebook</a>, reducing the default fields leads to faster performance. In the <a href="#selecting-specific-fields">Advanced Usage</a> section you'll find a example how the fields are requested with RestFB.</div>
