Facebook supports for a long time the connection between a Facebook business page and a Instagram business account. With this connection a business or creator can use an Facebook app to manager their presence on Instagram.

The API can be used to get and publish (only for partners in the beta progam) their media, manage and reply to comments on their media, identify media where they have been @mentioned by other Instagram users, find hashtagged media.

This API cannot be used for consumers.
